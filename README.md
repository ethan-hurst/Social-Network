# Just-Friends

## Installation

#### Backend Installation
From the Project root directory, please run ```npm install``` to install the dependancies for this project. 

#### Front-End Installation
Please run the following command to install the front end dependancies from the project root directory. ```cd client && npm install``` 

When the dependancies have installed you're able to run the server locally by running ```npm run server``` we are leveraging nodemon here to keep the server running with change tracking and hot-reloading as well as concurrently to do the same for the front-end react application
